# Clipboard Manager

A lightweight macOS clipboard manager built in Swift.  
Keeps track of your clipboard history, allows quick access to recent items, and supports auto-updates via Sparkle.

## Story

In 2026, I got my first Apple product — a MacBook Pro. Before that, I was a big Windows user. I found that macOS suited my workflow and felt faster than my old i5 HP laptop. However, one major downside was that macOS didn't include a built-in clipboard manager.  

So, I decided to code my own solution. With the help of ChatGPT and Claude, I’ve been learning Swift and gradually understanding how macOS works, building this project piece by piece.  

This project is open to everyone: you’re welcome to use the software, report bugs, or even contribute code to help make it better.
